OPP


Six algorithms for Optimal PMU Placement (OPP) problem, including two Simulated Annealing methods, two Graph Theoretic Procedures, and Recursive Security N Algorithm.

The five casexx.m files are the data of IEEE 14-,30-,57- and 118-bus systems and New England 39-bus system obtained from MatPower.

You can run test using the above systems through main.m or auto_test.m.

A detailed report about OPP problem and the six algorithms are in the project report file.
